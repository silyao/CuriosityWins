# CuriosityWins
This is my personal repository to entertain my curiosity on different programming topics.

## Completed Topics
So far I have experimented / implemented the following topics:
1. Producer And Consumer Patterns in Multi-Threading (May 2020)

## Topics In Mind
I also have these ideas in mind that I want to try them out:
1. Performances in List Iterations (with Functional Programing `stream` as one candidate)
