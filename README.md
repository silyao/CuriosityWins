# CuriosityWins
This is my personal repository to entertain my curiosity on different programming topics.

## Completed Topics
So far I have experimented / implemented the following topics:
1. Producer And Consumer Patterns in Multi-Threading (May 2020)
2. Performances in List Iterations (Jan 2022)

## Topics In Mind
I also have these ideas in mind that I want to try them out:
1. DateTime objects, the various packages associated with them and how to best represent them. 
   Inspired by [Microsoft Exchange Year 2022 Bug](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-emergency-fix-for-exchange-year-2022-bug/).
